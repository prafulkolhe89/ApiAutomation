In this set of test cases we would be validating the functionality of our get all Programs API

'''Given '''I want to search the list of programs based on different program attribute/attributes . (Program name, status, Id , Type)

'''When '''I send the data to the GetAPI

'''Then '''List of all the programs associated with the attributes should be fetched.

'''Retrieve list of Programs using Program Name'''

'''Pre-requisite Tables '''

''First we would be deleting all the programs by a passing {programName}''

!| DeleteAPI |
| recordsDeletionStatus? |
| true |

Now that All the data is deleted .

We will create programs by providing unique fileds in programName,type,Code field .

Number Of Programs To Be created - Specify the Number of Programs user needs to create with the specified combination of input.

!| CreateNewProgram |
| code | programname | status | type | NumberOfProgramsToBecreated | MultipleProgramCreated? |
| code0 | FitnesseProgram | Active | FitnesseProgramtype | 10 | [200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200] |

Validate the Total number of Elements getting displayed .!-
-!This would require some manual intervention

!| ValidateNewProgramGeneration |
| Id | programName | type | status | code | ProgramRetrived? | TotalElements? |
| blank | blank | blank | blank | blank | | |

In the Below Table we are actually validating the Retrieve list of Programs API.!-
-!In the second pre-requisite table we had created 10 records with the unique set of data.!-
-!So we will be validating if same number of records are being fetched at the output when searched with [[Program Name][ProgramName]], Type, Code

Size - Number of records to be viewed on one page(For Pagination purpose)

page - Page on which user needs to verify the records.This record should

Total Elements - Total number of records present for given mobile number

Total Pages - Total Elements/Records per page (size)

Number of Elements - Expected value of records present on current page.

!| ValidateNewProgramGeneration |
| programName | type | status | code | size | page | Program Retrived? | TotalElements? | Total pages? | PageSize? | Number of Elements? |
| FitnesseProgram | | | | 5 | 2 | | 10 | 2 | 5 | 5 |
| | FitnesseProgramtype | | | 2 | 5 | | 10 | 5 | 2 | 2 |
| | | | code0 | 10 | 1 | | 10 | 1 | 10 | 10 |
